# DoctrineModule for Zend Framework 3

Installation of DoctrineModule uses composer. For composer documentation, please refer to
[getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/).

```sh
php composer.phar require fanst1109/doctrine-module
```

Then add `DoctrineModule` to your `config/application.config.php`

Installation without composer is not officially supported, and requires you to install and autoload
the dependencies specified in the `composer.json`.
